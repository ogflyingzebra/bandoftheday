	Band Of The Day (8/9/15): Heavenly Beat </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="5"<FONT COLOR="#800000" <font face= Helvetica> Heavenly Beat is the side project of Beach Fossils bassist John Pena. 
He began writing and performing under the moniker in late 2009, crafting dreamy electro-pop around his gentle vocals.
The first Heavenly Beat release, the Suday single for Captured Tracks, arrived in 2011, followed by the Faithless single soon after.
Pena began work on a Heavenly Beat album in 2012, resulting in Talent, released that July.
He left Beach Fossils soon after to focus on Heavenly Beat full-time and began work on a second album. 
After scrapping the results of sessions that took place in a real studio, Pena retreated to his house to record. Prominence, which featured Pena playing all the instruments aside from a few keyboard parts done by Daniel Schlett and Christian Barsi, was released by Captured Tracks in October of 2013.
